# -Project---Data-Visualization-on-Heart-Disease-Dataset
Overview This project focuses on exploring and visualizing the Heart Disease dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding the factors contributing to heart disease. The aim is to utilize various data visualization techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 303 instances with 14 attributes, including both categorical and continuous features. The attributes are:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type (4 values)
Resting blood pressure
Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise induced angina
Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thal (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
Target (1: presence of heart disease, 0: absence of heart disease)
Project Structure
The project is organized into several parts:

## Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing/standardizing numerical features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate analysis
Bivariate analysis
Multivariate analysis
Data Visualization

Distribution plots (histograms, box plots)
Correlation heatmaps
Pair plots
Bar charts for categorical data
Line plots for time series trends (if applicable)
Scatter plots and bubble plots for detailed relationships
Insights and Findings

Summary of key insights discovered through the visualizations
Potential implications for medical research and patient care
Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries are used in this project:

## Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization
Plotly: For interactive visualizations
